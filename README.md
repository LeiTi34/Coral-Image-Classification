## Goal and Motivation
By creating accurate classification models, researchers and marine biologists can better understand the health and well-being of coral reefs, monitor changes in their environment, and contribute to the conservation and restoration of these vital ecosystems.

Conservation organizations can use the tool to regularly assess the health of coral reefs. By analyzing images from various locations, they can identify areas experiencing bleaching and prioritize conservation actions.
